# mentored_research2022
All of the code from my research project from the Fall 2022, using SKU data from Awatunai in Indonesia!

Here you will find Jupyter notebooks and .Rmd files where I tried methods and failed, and others where my succesful work is showcased! If you have any questions about my code, email me at carson.slater@my.wheaton.edu.


Iteration I is the first iteration of my project.

Iteration II is the second, where I am making a poster for the UIC 2022 Undergraduate Mathematics Symposium.
